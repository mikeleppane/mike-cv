                    I always strive for perseverance. My working morale is 
                    very high, and I'm committed to doing what I do. I

                    " I strongly advocate Behavior-Driven Development BDD
                    and Domain-Driven Design DDD methodologies. BDD 
                    enables me to bridge the gap between business and 
                    technical teams, ensuring that software meets real user 
                    needs. I focus on modeling software around real 
                    business domains with DDD, resulting in maintainable 
                    and scalable solutions. These approaches allow me to 
                    deliver high-quality software that aligns closely with 
                    user needs and business goals. In addition, I strongly 
                    advocate the clean code paradigm, consistently writing 
                    code that is readable, simple, and easy to maintain. 
                    Clean code improves software quality and enhances 
                    team productivity and long-term project success."

                    Python, which I have used extensively for software
                    development and test automation. I have also embraced
                    Rust in recent years, and I have been using it for about
                    four years. Learning Rust has deepened my
                    understanding of computer science concepts such as
                    memory management, concurrency, and system-level
                    programming. I enjoy leveraging its great type
